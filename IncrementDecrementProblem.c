// Let us consider the expression ++*p in first printf(). Since precedence of prefix ++ and * is same, associativity comes into picture. *p is evaluated first because both prefix ++ and * are right to left associative. When we increment *p by 1, it starts pointing to second character of “knowledge”. Therefore, the first printf statement prints “nowledge”.

// Let us consider the expression *p++ in second printf() . Since precedence of postfix ++ is higher than *, p++ is evaluated first. And since it’s a psotfix ++, old value of p is used in this expression. Therefore, second printf statement prints “nowledge”.

// In third printf statement, the new value of p (updated by second printf) is used, and third printf() prints “s”.
